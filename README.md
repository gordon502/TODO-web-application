# TODO-web-application

Application made in course [Java - ambitny start!](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-ambitny-start/).
Goal of this course was to learn how to build a small web application using Java with frameworks. At the beginning tutor shows how backend works without Spring using Jetty server with Servlets, ORM Mapping with Jackson-databinder and Hibernate, database migration with Flyway. Test Driven Delevopment and multi-tier architecture was also mentioned. Basic front-end is implemented, but tutor didn't spend much time on this section. At the end backend application was rewritten to Spring showing how many things this framework is doing for us and how simple it is.

Final application technology stack:
  * JAVA 11
  * Maven
  * Spring
  * Hibernate
  * Flyway
  * H2 database
  * HTML + CSS + JS
  * JUnit
